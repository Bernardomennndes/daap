## Document Maintenance

These documents were created during a comprehensive exploration of the testing infrastructure:

- **Creation Date**: October 30, 2025
- **Scope**: Complete testing infrastructure analysis
- **Coverage**: All 5 layers (load testing, metrics, strategies, unit tests, infrastructure)
- **Status**: Ready for reference and implementation

**To Update**:
1. When new testing tools are added
2. When infrastructure changes
3. When performance baselines change
4. When gaps are filled with implementations
5. Quarterly review for accuracy

## Contact & Contribution

For questions or updates to documentation:
1. Check if answer is in existing documents
2. Review code in packages/tools/
3. Check CLAUDE.md for project conventions
4. Update documentation if information changes
5. Commit documentation updates with code changes

## Summary

This complete testing infrastructure exploration provides:
- Quick reference for daily testing (TESTING_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)
- Comprehensive technical documentation (TESTING_INFRASTRUCTURE.md)
- Navigation index (this file)

The DAAP project has excellent testing foundations with ~3400 lines of testing code across 5 layers. The main limitation is lack of orchestration, which Phase 1 enhancements will address.

All materials needed to understand, run, maintain, and enhance the testing infrastructure are contained in these three documents and the referenced source code.
